Personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS 
✅ Task-04: Personal Portfolio Website
In this task, I designed and developed a professional Personal Portfolio Website to showcase my skills, projects, and accomplishments as a data science enthusiast and aspiring web developer. Built using HTML and CSS, the website features a visually appealing and responsive layout with a gradient-themed aesthetic. The Home Page includes a captivating headline, a professional photo, and a summary highlighting my strengths in Python, SQL, data visualization, and machine learning. The About Me section provides a deeper look into my academic background (B.Sc. in Data Science from Mulund College of Commerce), relevant coursework, tools, and certifications such as Azure AI Fundamentals, Microsoft Security, DevOps by IBM, and RPA. The Projects Section features a range of work—from sales data analysis and climate change prediction models to survey-based insights on AI and employment. Finally, a Contact Section links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles, making it easy for visitors or recruiters to connect with me. This portfolio reflects my personal brand and serves as a central hub for showcasing my growing expertise and passion for data science and web development.
